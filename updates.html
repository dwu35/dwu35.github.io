Description:<br>
Finished a rough idea for a start menu and added invisible walls in the scene to keep it the map confined. <br>
Also replaced the temporary audio with proper background music that was produced by Adrian von Ziegler and ditributed for free which can be found at their website: https://adrianvonziegler.bandcamp.com/track/atmospheres.<br>
The interaction script has been added but it doesn't have any actual use in game yet. <br>
Things I plan on working on next is to add a pause menu in the actual game that allows you to go back to the main menu and <br>
add functionality for interactions which include picking up notes scattered around the map and to be able to interact with the door on one of the buildings. <br>
These two tutorials from SpeedTutor covers what I want with the notes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMTCx4_5Jqc and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJiO4cvsHAo
