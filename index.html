Name:<br>
Forgotten Village

Description:<br>
For this project, I plan on creating a simple story through the use of notes spread across the map that serves as a narrative for the short game.
The project serves as a rough idea for a forgotten village set on a fictional continent called Illyria I created myself that is surrounded by a dense fog.
The gameplay itself is extremely short and features only 3 simple notes that give a quick glimpse into what has happened into the village.
The purpose of this project is to serve as a way to develop my fictitious world by giving it more depth through various means.
