Temporary Name:<br>
Gravekeeper

Description:<br>
For this project, I plan on creating a simple story through the use of notes spread across the map that serves as a narrative for the short game.
Taking inspiration from an indie game, Graveyard Keeper, developed by Lazy Bear Games, I want to have an extremely rough/basic management for skeletons in the game.
